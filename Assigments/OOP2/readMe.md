## Abstractions in the Solution

In our project, we use a concept called **abstraction** to make our code easier to understand and work with. Abstraction is like providing a simplified view of something complex, allowing us to use it without worrying about the nitty-gritty details.

### 1. **Abstract Class: `CourseContent`**

Imagine we have different types of content in our courses, like text, videos, or quizzes. To keep things neat, we created a blueprint called `CourseContent` that helps us work with any type of content. This blueprint has a rule: every type of content must know how to display itself. We call this the `displayContent` rule, and it keeps things consistent.

```javascript
class CourseContent {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
  }

  displayContent() {
    // Every content type must know how to display itself
    throw new Error(
      "Abstract method 'displayContent' must be implemented in subclasses."
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. **Abstraction in `Student` Class: Viewing Course Content**

Now, for students who want to view their course content, we keep it simple. We don't want them to worry about how each type of content works. So, we created a method called `viewCourseContent(course)` that uses the `displayContent` rule from our `CourseContent` blueprint. Students just need to say "show me the content," and our code takes care of the rest!

```javascript
class Student extends User {
  // ... (other methods)

  viewCourseContent(course) {
    // Just show the content, no need to know the details
    course.displayCourseContent();
  }

  // ... (other methods)
}
```

### 3. **Easy-to-Use Methods**

Each part of our code (like students, tutors, and administrators) has its own set of tasks. We make sure they only see what they need to see. For example, tutors can upload content and check how students are doing, but they don't need to worry about the inner workings. This way, everyone can focus on their job without getting overwhelmed.

By using these abstractions, we make our code friendlier for beginners. It's like using a TV remote â€“ you don't need to know how the buttons work inside; you just press what you need!

## Polymorphism in the Solution

In our project, we leverage the power of **polymorphism** to handle different types of course content seamlessly. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same type through a common interface, providing flexibility and extensibility in our code.

### 1. **Abstract Class: `CourseContent`**

We started by creating an abstract class named `CourseContent`. This class defines a common interface with an abstract method `displayContent`, ensuring that every type of course content must implement this method. This abstraction sets the stage for polymorphic behavior.

```javascript
class CourseContent {
  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;
  }

  displayContent() {
    // Abstract method to display content, to be implemented by subclasses
    throw new Error(
      "Abstract method 'displayContent' must be implemented in subclasses."
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. **Polymorphism in Action: `TextContent` and `VideoContent`**

We then introduced two concrete classes, `TextContent` and `VideoContent`, each extending the `CourseContent` class. These subclasses implement the `displayContent` method differently, showcasing polymorphism.

```javascript
class TextContent extends CourseContent {
  // ... (constructor and specific implementation of displayContent)
}

class VideoContent extends CourseContent {
  // ... (constructor and specific implementation of displayContent)
}
```

### 3. **Polymorphic Display in `Course` Class**

The `Course` class takes advantage of polymorphism in its `displayCourseContent` method. This method can handle an array of different content types, whether it's text, video, or any future content type, without knowing the specific details of each type.

```javascript
class Course extends CourseContent {
  // ... (other methods)

  displayCourseContent() {
    console.log(`Course Content for "${this.title}":`);
    this.content.forEach((item) => item.displayContent());
  }

  // ... (other methods)
}
```

### 4. **Reasoning**

By using polymorphism, we make our code more adaptable to changes. If we introduce new types of content in the future, we can easily integrate them into the system without modifying existing code. Each type of content adheres to the common interface defined by the `CourseContent` class, promoting a consistent and maintainable design.
